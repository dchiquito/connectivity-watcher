# connectivity-watcher

I've been having spotty internet, so I wrote this script to watch for downtimes.

## Installation
You will need the dbus dev libraries installed to install the package:

```
sudo apt-get install libdbus-glib-1-dev libdbus-1-dev
pip install -e .
```

## Run
```
python watch.py
```
